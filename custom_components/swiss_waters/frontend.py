"""Serving of the bundled dashboard strategy.

The frontend/ directory of this integration is served under a static URL.
It holds a single file, the dashboard strategy, which the browser turns
into a dashboard at display time. Registering that file as a Lovelace
resource is deliberately left to the user: an integration must not write
into the Lovelace storage, which belongs to the user's dashboard
configuration. The README documents the one-time registration.

The directory is served with cache_headers=False, so a browser picks up an
updated file after a reload without a version query string on the URL.
